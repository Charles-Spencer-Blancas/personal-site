Blog</h1>
            <p class="date">Date: 2023-08-12</p>
            <p>I’ve been itching to do some writing lately. And not a
            lab report or documention—something more creative and
            opinionated. The last time I had to write that type of text
            was around two years ago in English class. But I did not
            appreciate writing then. Partly because I did not care about
            the topics I was writing about, and partly because I felt
            pressure since it was graded. Now felt like the time to
            start writing again, and a blog seemed like a good place to
            start.</p>
            <h1 id="mental-hurdles">Mental Hurdles</h1>
            <p>I have always thought about starting a blog. After all,
            according to those tech career gurus, it’s a good way to
            build a personal brand. That idea was never enough to make
            me start because I just did not like the idea of writing.
            But that changed when I got into reading books. I started to
            appreciate how writers wonderfully weave words together to
            open a window to their thoughts or to a completely different
            world. I wanted to do that too.</p>
            <p>However, just wanting to do it was not enough—I still had
            stage fright. Instead of my English professors grading my
            work, it would be the public judging me (or so I told
            myself). So I decided to call this blog “Notes to Self.” I’m
            writing this for me. Of course, I am open to
            criticism—that’s why this is a blog and not a journal in my
            drawer—but the main audience for this blog is myself. I’ll
            write about things that I want to write about, be they
            tech-related or in another field completely, and I will make
            it enjoyable for myself to read. If other people like it
            too, that’s just icing on the cake. I won’t limit the form
            of the content I write; there will be classic blogposts like
            this one, but if I want to write a short story or a comic,
            I’ll drop that here too.</p>
            <h1 id="the-tech-stack">The Tech Stack</h1>
            <p>I probably should have used a blogging platform such as
            Medium, but where’s the fun in that? So I decided to build
            the site myself. And I probably should have used an SSG such
            as Astro, but where’s the fun in that? So I decided to build
            the site with vanilla HTML and CSS, pandoc to transform
            Markdown into HTML, and a Python script to glue it all
            together.</p>
            <p>I found a way to include HTML files from <a
            href="https://css-tricks.com/the-simplest-ways-to-handle-html-includes/#aa-use-iframes">this
            blogpost from CSS-Tricks</a> which links to <a
            href="https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/html-includes/">this
            one by Scott Jehl</a>. For now, I only use it for the
            header, but it allows me to use vanilla HTML, which makes
            this site really simple: I write HTML files for the static
            pages such as <a href="/src">the home page for this
            site</a>, and for pages that depend on Markdown content, I
            use a Python script.</p>
            <p>In that Python script, I call Pandoc to generate HTML
            from Markdown based on a template, which I saw from <a
            href="https://www.arthurkoziel.com/convert-md-to-html-pandoc/">this
            blogpost by Arthur Koziel</a> and <a
            href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates">the Pandoc
            docs (the Pandocs?)</a>. Blogposts are automagically
            generated by Pandoc based on a template with no fiddling
            from me, but I still had to write the code to generate <a
            href="/src/notes-to-self/">the index page for this
            blog</a>.</p>
            <p>I wanted the site to be minimalist with sharp corners and
            a splash of pastel, so I made it minimalist with sharp
            corners and a splash of pastel. Like my other web projects,
            I started with <a
            href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">normalize.css</a>
            and then styled from there. I added a header, cards, and
            some light animation because I think it looks cool.</p>
            <p>I only planned to have a light theme, because that is
            what I use 90% of the time, but I saw <a
            href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36745650">this
            Hacker News comment</a> that showed how easy it was to have
            dark mode. To support it, all I needed to do was add a
            separate set of colors, which was simple since I had
            variables for my colors (seriously, why don’t all minimalist
            websites do this?).</p>
            <p>I’ll be hosting this on GitHub Pages since that’s where I
            plan to keep the Git repo anyway.</p>
            <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
            <p>I’m excited to be writing again, especially without the
            pressure of a potentially low grade looming over me. Now
            that this site is built, there are no hurdles for me to
            write, but I won’t force myself since that’s a surefire way
            to suck the fun out of it.</p>
